## Introduction

Whirlibulf is an **Entity-Component-System** Javascript game engine.

On its own, it provides only very basic functionality, and is not very useful for developing a game.

The engine depends on external packages called **Systems** and **Components** to provide the tools to develop a game.

Here's some reading material if you haven't encountered the Entity-Component-System design before:
