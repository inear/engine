# whirlibulf

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Component](https://github.com/component/component)


## Installation

    $ component install whirlibulf/engine


## Getting Started

First, create a new project with component:

    $ component create

Once component has created a new project folder for you, install the engine:

    $ component install whirlibulf/engine

Once the engine is installed, you can install systems and components that you
may need for your game.

For example:

    $ component install whirlibulf/transform-component
    $ component install whirlibulf/canvas-system
    $ component install whirlibulf/primitive-shapes-component
    $ component install whirlibulf/script-system


## Introduction

Whirlibulf is a Javascript game engine.

On its own, it provides only very basic functionality, and is not very useful for developing a game.

The engine depends on external packages called **Systems** and **Components** to provide the tools to develop a game.

Here's some reading material if you haven't encountered the entity-component-system design before:
